              <p>My first crack at coding. After our second lecture, I was handed an image and told to recreate it in the browser for homework. Using html/css, this was the outcome.</p>

              <p>We quickly jumped right into GitHub and Javascript. This app was the first collaborative project using GitHub where I learned how to develop on a team. It is a functioning Point-of-Sale app utilizing Javascript libraries such as jQuery and Underscore.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't too long ago that I was aimlessly traveling around the country, hitting things with sticks, taking in the sights.......making music. I have pursued drumming since I was a wee lad. It's all I ever wanted to do until one fateful night comprised of good food, good music, and good friends. This was the night I was enlightened that there was a little code school down the road that I should give some serious thought to. It turns out that little code school does big things. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "The Iron Yard", a good friend tells me. It sounded like a place I was hoping to never see the inside walls. So, I researched. I applied. I was accepted. Upon successfully completing the most grueling code school that exists, these are now some of my favorite walls. Littered with dry-erase murals, surrounding some really great thinkers, and fostering an environment that demands high-level thought, I have transferred my creative passion in music to a new found passion that is web development.

                    <h4>What did I learn you ask?</h4>
                    <p>
                       How to think like a programmer and learn how to learn as I further develop my skills. I love challenging myself and solving complex problems. My life is about creating things that give an end-user great satisfaction whether, it is playing a concert or building an intricate application. I have learned that road-blocks in programming are more like speed bumps. By taking a step back and applying logical thought to a problem the road then becomes nivagable. I have learned a lot in a short time, including such things as:
                       <br>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Team workflows using Git and GitHub</li>
                        <li>HTML5/CSS3 - Responsive Design, Layouts, Animations, Typography, etc.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript - Unit Testing via Mocha and Jasmine, Types, Functions, Objects, Scope, Closures, Constructors, Prototypes, JSON, etc.</li>
                        <li>jQuery - DOM Manipulation, Non-DOM methods, Chaining, Callbacks and Promises, AJAX, and plugins</li>
                        <li>Functional Programming principles via Underscore.js</li>
                        <li>MVC's such as Backbone.js - Templating,Handling JSON payloads, data persistence, and smart view management</li>
                        <li>Parse as Backend</li>
                        <li>Package managers</li>
