                    <p>It wasn't too long ago that I was aimlessly traveling around the country, hitting things with sticks, taking in the sights.......making music. I have pursued drumming since I was a wee lad. It's all I ever wanted to do until one fateful night comprised of good food, good music, and good friends. This was the night I was enlightened that there was a little code school down the road that I should give some serious thought to. It turns out that little code school does big things. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "The Iron Yard", a good friend tells me. It sounded like a place I was hoping to never see the inside walls. So, I researched. I applied. I was accepted. Upon successfully completing the most grueling code school that exists, these are now some of my favorite walls. Littered with dry-erase murals, surrounding some really great thinkers, and fostering an environment that demands high-level thought, I have transferred my creative passion in music to a new found passion that is web development.

                    <h3>What did I learn you ask?</h3>
                    </p><p>
                       How to think like a programmer and learn how to learn as I further develop my skills. I love challenging myself and solving complex problems. My life is about creating things that give an end-user great satisfaction whether, it is playing a concert or building an intricate application. I have learned that road-blocks in programming are more like speed bumps. By taking a step back and applying logical thought to a problem the road then becomes nivagable. I have learned a lot in a short time, including such things as:
                       <br>
                       <ul>
                        <li><strong>Git and GitHub</strong> - version control skills and team workflows</li>
                        <li><strong>HTML5/CSS3</strong> - responsive design, layouts, animations, typography, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - unit testing via Mocha and Jasmine, types, functions, objects, scope, closures, constructors, prototypes, JSON, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>jQuery</strong> - DOM manipulation, Non-DOM methods, chaining, callbacks and promises, AJAX, and plugins</li>
                        <li><strong>Underscore.js</strong> - templating and functional programming principles</li>
                        <li><strong>Backbone.js</strong> - understanding of MVC's, Handling JSON payloads, data persistence, and smart view management</li>
                        <li><strong>Parse</strong> - as a backend, along with wrangling of API's</li>
                        <li><strong>Yeoman</strong> - front-end package managers, tools, asset loaders, and generators</li>
                        ......and it goes on and on......
                       </ul>
